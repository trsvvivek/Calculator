## About

This project is a basic implementation of a calculator that supports basic mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator allows users to input numbers, select operators, and perform calculations. It is designed to be lightweight and easy to use, making it a perfect project for beginners learning web development.

The calculator's interface is styled with CSS, and JavaScript is used for managing the logic and calculations.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Supports addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
- **Real-Time Input:** As you type, the result is displayed instantly.
- **Clear Function:** A "C" button to clear the input and reset the calculator.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout adapts to both desktop and mobile devices for a smooth user experience.
- **Simple and Clean UI:** A minimalistic interface with easy-to-read buttons and results.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the calculator interface (buttons, input field, etc.).
- **CSS**: Styles the layout, buttons, and overall visual appearance of the calculator.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the logic for number input, operator handling, calculation, and resetting the result.

## How to Use

1. **Start the Calculator:** Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser (such as Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
2. **Enter Numbers:** Click the number buttons (0-9) to input the digits you want to calculate.
3. **Choose Operator:** Click one of the operator buttons (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) to select an operation.
4. **Calculate Result:** Press the `=` button to calculate the result of the operation.
5. **Clear Input:** Click the `C` button to clear the current input and reset the calculator.
